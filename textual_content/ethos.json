      "content": "The logo was designed by Sarada Ukil, an artist of great repute and a teacher at Modern School in the 1920s. The school crest signifies the circle of eternity crossed by the three elements in human development—body, mind and spirit—with the sun shining between the triangle and the circle. Inside the triangle is a banyan tree representing stability and firmness of character; the swan and the lotus symbolise refinement, culture and the arts—the fundamental elements of progress in life."
