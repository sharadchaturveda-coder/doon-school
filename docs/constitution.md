# Project Constitution

## Doon International School Website - Constitutional Framework

This constitution establishes the immutable principles governing all development work on the Doon International School website project. It embodies Specification-Driven Development (SDD) principles as defined in `sdd.md` and serves as the architectural DNA that ensures consistency, simplicity, and quality across all implementations.

## Preamble

The Doon International School website shall be developed following SDD principles where specifications drive implementation rather than code serving as the primary artifact. All development must maintain strict adherence to these constitutional articles to ensure maintainable, scalable, and quality-focused outcomes.

---

## Article I: Static-First Principle

**Status: IMMUTABLE**

Every feature and content system in the Doon International School website MUST begin and remain as a static-first implementation.

### Requirements:
- All content SHALL be stored in JSON files within the `/data` directory
- No traditional CMS integrations without explicit constitutional amendment
- Content updates SHALL occur through JSON file modifications only
- Static generation SHALL be preferred over runtime data fetching

### Rationale:
Static-first ensures maximum performance, reliability, and simplicity. Content can be easily managed through version control without complex infrastructure.

---

## Article II: Component-First Architecture

**Status: IMMUTABLE**

Every user interface element SHALL be implemented as a reusable component library.

### Requirements:
- All UI elements SHALL exist as standalone components in `/components`
- Components SHALL be imported and composed rather than written inline
- Component APIs SHALL be TypeScript-interfaced and well-documented
- No duplicate UI implementations permitted

### Rationale:
Component-first design ensures consistency, maintainability, and reusability. It prevents scattered UI logic and promotes atomic design principles.

---

## Article III: TypeScript-First Development

**Status: IMMUTABLE**

All code SHALL be written in TypeScript with strict type safety.

### Requirements:
- `strict: true` SHALL be maintained in `tsconfig.json`
- No use of `any` type permitted without explicit justification
- All function parameters and return values SHALL be properly typed
- Type guards and discriminated unions SHALL be preferred over type assertions

### Rationale:
Type safety prevents runtime errors, improves developer experience, and serves as living documentation of system contracts.

---

## Article IV: Test-First Imperative

**Status: IMMUTABLE**

Implementation SHALL follow Test-Driven Development principles.

### Requirements:
- Test files SHALL be created alongside source files
- `npm run test` SHALL pass for all TypeScript-first implementations
- Tests SHALL cover critical user journeys before implementation
- Integration tests SHALL validate component composition

### Rationale:
Tests ensure reliability and prevent regressions. Test-first validates understanding of requirements before expensive implementation investment.

---

## Article VII: Simplicity Gate

**Status: IMMUTABLE**

Implementation complexity SHALL be carefully controlled and justified.

### Requirements:
- Maximum 3 projects in the repository (current: 1 Next.js app)
- No future-proofing or speculative features without user need validation
- YAGNI principle SHALL be strictly followed
- Additional dependencies require documented justification

### Rationale:
Simplicity reduces maintenance burden and prevents over-engineering. Each added complexity increases technical debt exponentially.

---

## Article VIII: Framework-Trust Gate

**Status: IMMUTABLE**

Framework features SHALL be used directly rather than abstracted unnecessarily.

### Requirements:
- Next.js App Router SHALL be used directly without wrapper abstractions
- Tailwind CSS SHALL be used directly without component libraries that abstract it
- Framer Motion SHALL be used directly without animation abstraction layers
- Only domain-specific abstractions are permitted

### Rationale:
Framework trust reduces indirection and potential bugs. Direct framework usage ensures we stay current with updates and understand system behavior.

---

## Article IX: Integration-First Testing

**Status: IMMUTABLE**

Tests SHALL use realistic environments and actual dependencies.

### Requirements:
- Prefer real data sources (`data/*.json`) over mocks for integration tests
- Component tests SHALL use real child components rather than mocks
- Avoid unnecessary test doubles - use actual implementations when possible
- Performance tests SHALL measure real usage patterns

### Rationale:
Integration-first testing ensures features work in production-like conditions, preventing false confidence from isolated unit tests.

---

## Article X: Documentation-Driven Development

**Status: IMMUTABLE**

All features and changes SHALL be documented before implementation.

### Requirements:
- Documentation SHALL be updated concurrently with code changes
- README files SHALL be maintained for all component directories
- API interfaces SHALL be documented with TypeScript comments
- Breaking changes SHALL update documentation synchronously

### Rationale:
Documentation serves as the primary interface for specifications. In SDD, documentation is the source of truth, not just reference material.

---

## Constitutional Amendment Process

**Section 4.2: Amendments**

Modifications to this constitution require formal review:

1. **Change Proposal**: Submit amendment with clear rationale and impact assessment
2. **Impact Analysis**: Evaluate effects on existing codebase and development velocity
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure all amendments maintain compatibility
4. **Approval**: Both specification author and implementation maintainer must approve
5. **Documentation**: Amendment SHALL be documented with effective date

### Historical Amendments
- **None** - This is the initial constitutional establishment

---

## Constitutional Enforcement Through SDD Templates

### Specification Template Compliance
All feature specifications SHALL include:
- [ ] Constitutional gate assessment for each relevant article
- [ ] Complexity justification statements where gates are challenged
- [ ] Technical debt assessment and mitigation plans

### Implementation Plan Governance
All plans SHALL document:
- [ ] Specific constitutional articles being invoked
- [ ] Gate challenges and analytical justification
- [ ] Fallback plans if constitutional violations occur
- [ ] Performance impact assessments

### Task Breakdown Standards
All task breakdowns SHALL:
- [ ] Mark parallel execution opportunities `[P]`
- [ ] Include constitutional compliance checkpoints
- [ ] Document prerequisite relationships
- [ ] Define success criteria traceable to constitutions

---

## Emergency Constitutional Violations

**Section 5.1: Emergency Override**

In cases of critical system failure requiring immediate action, constitutional violations may be granted if:
1. Risk to production system outweighs constitutional benefit
2. Violation is temporary and time-bound
3. Restoration plan includes constitutional compliance path
4. All violations are documented with restoration timeline

Emergency violations require immediate post-mortem analysis and constitutional improvement.

---

## Constitutional Quality Assurance

### Regular Audits
Quarterly constitutional compliance audits SHALL be performed:
- Scan codebase for violations of current constitutional articles
- Analyze technical debt introduced by past violations
- Review architecture decisions against current principles
- Update constitutional understanding based on practical experience

### Metrics and Monitoring
Constitutional health SHALL be tracked through:
- Compliance percentages in code reviews
- Violation frequency and resolution time
- Technical debt interest payments
- Development velocity impact assessments

This constitution establishes the fundamental rules that will guide all development work on the Doon International School website. It creates a stable foundation for quality, maintainability, and predictable evolution of the system under SDD methodology.
