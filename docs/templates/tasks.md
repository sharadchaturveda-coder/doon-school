## Task Execution Guidelines

### Parallel Execution Opportunities **[P]**

Tasks marked with **[P]** can run in parallel with other marked tasks. Examples:

**Safe Parallel Groups:**
- Group 1: Tasks 2.1 + 2.2 (Data + Components)
- Group 2: Tasks 3.1 + 3.2 (Unit Tests + Accessibility)
- Group 3: Tasks 3.3 + 3.4 (Cross-browser + Performance)

**Parallel Execution Rules:**
1. Respect explicit dependencies marked in task descriptions
2. Communicate with team members about parallel work
3. Coordinate merges for dependent tasks
4. Document any conflicts or blocking issues immediately

### Task State Management

**Task States:**
- `[ ]` Not started
- `[-]` In progress
- `[x]` Completed
- `[?]` Blocked (describe blocker)

**State Transitions:**
- Move tasks to `[-]` when starting work
- Document blockages with `[?]` and explanation
- Mark complete with `[x]` only when acceptance criteria met

### Quality Gates

**Intra-Task Gates:**
- **Code Review Gate:** No task complete without peer review
- **Test Gate:** All tasks require passing tests before completion
- **Documentation Gate:** Documentation updated before task closure

**Milestone Gates:**
- **Foundation Complete:** All Section 1 tasks completed
- **Implementation Complete:** All Section 2 tasks completed before QA
- **QA Complete:** All Section 3 tasks completed before documentation
- **Ready for Production:** All acceptance criteria validated

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Execution Risks

#### Risk 1: Task Dependencies Not Respected
- **Impact:** Schedule delay, integration issues
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Strict dependency checking in daily standups

#### Risk 2: Parallel Work Conflicts
- **Impact:** Merge conflicts, duplicate work
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Daily sync meetings, clear task boundaries

#### Risk 3: Requirement Changes
- **Impact:** Rework required, scope creep
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Specification frozen after approval, change control process

#### Risk 4: External Dependencies
- **Impact:** Task delays, integration issues
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Early identification and monitoring

### Contingency Plans

#### For Schedule Slips
1. Identify critical path tasks that can be accelerated
2. Consider simplifying non-critical requirements
3. Communicate early with stakeholders
4. Extend timeline with justification

#### For Quality Issues
1. Stop work and fix root cause immediately
2. Add regression tests for discovered issues
3. Perform additional testing for similar components
4. Document lessons learned for future tasks
