## Final Deployment Steps

### Production Deployment
1. [ ] Push scope-freeze branch to main
2. [ ] Vercel automatic deployment triggers
3. [ ] Verify deployed site loads correctly
4. [ ] Test all 4 pages for functionality
5. [ ] Confirm navigation works properly

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. [ ] Run Lighthouse performance audit
2. [ ] Check console for any JavaScript errors
3. [ ] Verify contact form submissions
4. [ ] Test on multiple devices/browsers

### Documentation Update
1. [ ] Mark scope freeze complete in `specifications.md`
2. [ ] Update deployment history
3. [ ] Archive implementation plan in `/specs/completed/`

---

## Success Criteria Achieved

- [x] **75% Route Reduction**: From 16+ routes to 4 core pages
- [x] **Bundle Optimization**: Maintained or improved performance
- [x] **Content Preservation**: All critical school information retained
- [x] **Constitutional Compliance**: Article VII fully satisfied
- [x] **Quality Maintenance**: Accessibility and standards preserved

---

**Deployment Status:** ✅ APPROVED
**Scope Freeze Declaration:** From bloated complexity to constitutional MVP in 3 focused work sessions.

---

## Emergency Rollback (If Needed)

```bash
# Git rollback (if deployment issues)
git revert <latest-commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Revert documentation
mv archived-data/* data/
# Restore full navigation in site.json
```

This maintains system stability while achieving 75% complexity reduction per constitutional mandate.
