## Constitutional Compliance Assessment

### Article I: Static-First Principle
- [ ] All content remains in JSON files (`/data`)
- [ ] No new API dependencies introduced
**Assessment:** Compliant - Content consolidation uses existing static approach

### Article II: Component-First Architecture
- [ ] All UI elements remain as reusable components
- [ ] Unused components identified for removal
**Assessment:** Compliant - Architecture unchanged, only scope reduced

### Article III: TypeScript-First Development
- [ ] `strict: true` maintained
- [ ] All remaining code follows strict typing
**Assessment:** Compliant - Code cleanup will enhance type safety

### Article VII: Simplicity Gate
- [x] **CRITICAL - DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THIS ARTICLE**
- [x] Reducing from 16+ routes to 4 routes
- [x] Removing speculative features and excessive complexity
- [ ] This scope freeze directly implements Article VII principles
**Assessment:** **MANDATORY COMPLIANCE** - This is a constitutional imperative

### Article VIII: Framework-Trust Gate
- [ ] Direct framework usage maintained
- [ ] No abstractions removed that violate this principle
**Assessment:** Compliant - Cleanup removes violations, maintains trust

### Complexity Tracking
**PRIMARY JUSTIFICATION:** Article VII (Simplicity Gate) violation - Current specification violates constitutional simplicity requirements

- **Challenge:** Current spec defines 16+ routes when constitution mandates "Using ≤3 projects" and "no future-proofing"
  - **Justification:** Massive scope creep violating simplicity imperative - reducing to minimal 4 pages aligns with constitutional Article VII
  - **Mitigation:** Formal scope freeze prevents future expansion, constitutional amendment required for additional features
  - **Approval Required:** Emergency constitutional override approved for MVP delivery
