## Task Execution Guidelines

### Parallel Execution Opportunities **[P]**

Tasks marked with **[P]** can run in parallel within their section. For this scope freeze:

**Safe Parallel Groups:**
- QA Tasks 3.1 + 3.2: Functional + Performance testing can run simultaneously
- QA Tasks 3.1 + 3.3: Functional + Accessibility can overlap

**Parallel Execution Rules:**
1. Respect explicit dependencies in task descriptions
2. Test incrementally during parallel work
3. Coordinate potential navigation/component conflicts
4. Document any parallel work issues immediately

### Task State Management

**Task States:**
- `[ ]` Not started
- `[-]` In progress
- `[x]` Completed
- `[?]` Blocked (describe blocker)

**State Transitions:**
- Move tasks to `[-]` when starting work
- Document blockages as `[?]` with explanation and resolution plan
- Mark complete with `[x]` only when all acceptance criteria met

### Quality Gates

**Intra-Task Gates:**
- **Code Review Gate:** No task complete without self-review
- **Build Gate:** All tasks require successful `npm run build`
- **Test Gate:** QA tasks require passing checks before completion

**Milestone Gates:**
- **Setup Complete:** Section 1 tasks completed, baseline established
- **Implementation Complete:** Section 2 tasks completed, site functional with 4 pages
- **QA Complete:** Section 3 tasks completed, performance and accessibility verified
- **Production Ready:** Section 4 tasks completed, deployment approved

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Execution Risks

#### Risk 1: Critical Content Loss During Consolidation
- **Impact:** High - missing school information harms admissions
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Pre-consolidation content audit and backup strategy

#### Risk 2: Navigation or Functionality Breakage
- **Impact:** High - site unusable if navigation fails
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Incremental testing after each route removal

#### Risk 3: Performance Degradation from Changes
- **Impact:** Medium - slow site hurts user experience
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Performance testing in QA phase with baseline comparison

#### Risk 4: Constitutional Non-Compliance
- **Impact:** High - invalidates entire approach
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Regular compliance checks against Article VII

### Contingency Plans

#### For Content Loss
1. Restore from /archived-content/ backup directory
2. Consult stakeholders for missing content requirements
3. Implement content gap fill before deployment

#### For Technical Breakage
1. Reverse git commits incrementally to isolate issue
2. Restore component imports if accidentally removed
3. Test each page individually before consolidation

#### For Schedule Delays
1. Prioritize functional testing over comprehensive documentation
2. Simplify QA scope if needed (focus on critical user journeys)
3. Communicate delays with justification immediately
